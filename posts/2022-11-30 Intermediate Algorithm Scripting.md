# Introduction
Today I learned how to test your skills with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges.
Algorithm scripting is basically a way of creating a function that takes a variety of inputs and gives a variety of outputs.

# Body
-Sum All Prime:A prime number is a whole number greater than 1 with exactly two divisors: 1 and itself. For example, 2 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and 2. In contrast, 4 is not prime since it is divisible by 1, 2 and 4.

-Smallest Common:The range will be an array of two numbers that will not necessarily be in numerical order.
                 
                :For example, if given 1 and 3, find the smallest common multiple of both 1 and 3 that is also evenly divisible by all numbers between 1 and 3. The answer here would be 6.

-Everything Be True:The predicate pre will be an object property and you need to return true if its value is truthy. Otherwise, return false.
In JavaScript, truthy values are values that translate to true when evaluated in a Boolean context.

-Arguments Optional:A function that sums two arguments together. If only one argument is provided, then return a function that expects one argument and returns the sum.
                   :For example, addTogether(2, 3) should return 5, and addTogether(2) should return a function.
                   :Calling this returned function with a single argument will then return the sum:
                   :var sumTwoAnd = addTogether(2);
                   sumTwoAnd(3) returns 5.

-Map the Debris:According to Kepler's Third Law, the orbital period  T  of two point masses orbiting each other in a circular or elliptic orbit is:
                :T=2πa3μ−−−√
                :a  is the orbit's semi-major axis
                 μ=GM  is the standard gravitational parameter
                 G is the gravitational constant,
                 M is the mass of the more massive body.

# Conclusion
Algorithm Scripting  It's like a function in math except it can take in a lot of different types of data, such as arrays, strings, numbers and so on.
