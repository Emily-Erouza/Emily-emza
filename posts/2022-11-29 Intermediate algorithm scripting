# Introduction
Today I learned how to test your skills with the Intermediate Algorithm Scripting challenges.
Algorithm scripting is basically a way of creating a function that takes a variety of inputs and gives a variety of outputs.


# body
a.Sum All Numbers in a Range: when an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers plus the sum of all the numbers between them. The lowest number will not always come first.

b.Diff Two Arrays: when you compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both. In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays.

c.Spinal Tap Case: Convert a string to spinal case. Spinal case is all-lowercase-words-joined-by-dashes.

Pig Latin: Is a way of altering English Words.
- If a word begins with a consonant, take the first consonant or consonant cluster, move it to the end of the word, and add ay to it.

- If a word begins with a vowel, just add way at the end.

d.DNA Pairing: Pairs of DNA strands consist of nucleobase pairs. Base pairs are represented by the characters AT and CG, which form building blocks of the DNA double helix.

-For example: for the input GCG, return [["G", "C"], ["C","G"], ["G", "C"]]

e.Convert HTML Entities: <, >, " (double quote), and ' (apostrophe), in a string to their corresponding HTML entities.

# conclusion
 algorithm Scripting  It's like a function in math except it can take in a lot of different types of data, such as arrays, strings, numbers and so on.
